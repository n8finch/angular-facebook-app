# Angular Facebook App from the angular-seed 

Test live application here: [https://n8finch.com/ng-social/]()

##Description

Uses the Facebook API to login to a SPA and get your information and posts, as well as post to Facebook. 

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install everything, make sure you have `node` and `bower` installed

### Install Dependencies

Requires ngFacebook from : [https://github.com/godisco/ngfacebook]() 

You also need to use `https`, so perhaps installing on a subdirectory of your `https` website is best. I've done that here: [https://n8finch.com/ng-social/]()

You also need an AppID from Facebook Developers, which you can get here: [https://developers.facebook.com/apps]().

### Run the Application

You can download a zip file, and upload everything in the `app` folder to a subfolder of your site, after you include your AppID in the `facebook/facebook.js` file. 

You will be asked to log in with your Facebook creds and then asked to authorize the app. 

## Known Issues

- Does not display all User Info in current response. Need to fix.
